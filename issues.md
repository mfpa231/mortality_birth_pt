# Issues and limits to my project

## Bug
The main bug seems to be at the end of the animation when the button changes to 'Restart'. Here the 'r' is slightly hidden but once the cursor hovers on the button, the problem is solved.

## Improvements
- Some circles are not completely drawn out
- It would be useful to find a more aesthetic solution for where to place the key so that is it neither to close to the graph nor too far away
- Axes that do not start at zero is not the best solution but this was done to prevent the data from being squashed onto one side
- Perhaps there are too many variables shown at once which may confuse the user
